# Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### List of software, firmware and hardware you may require.
* You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

### Files used
1. The following file contains necessary code:
   * bikeshare.py	
2. The following files are not uploaded to remote repo by using **.gitignore** because the files are too big:
   * chicago.csv
   * new_york_city.csv
   * washington.csv
